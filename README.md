This is the repo for the Core Electronics [PiicoDev Colour Sensor VEML6040](https://core-electronics.com.au/catalog/product/view/sku/CE07823).

Use the PiicoDev® Colour Sensor to measure the RGBW components of light, or even extract the colour of an object so you can compare apples with oranges. Onboard is a high accuracy colour sensor - the VEML6040 boasts 16-bit precision for each channel (R, G, B, W). By using PiicoDev adapters and cables, you can connect to this sensor without soldering - or use the standard breakout header if you prefer breadboard prototyping. Whichever you prefer, the PiicoDev guides will get you measuring colour in no time!
